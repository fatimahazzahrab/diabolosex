            <b>1917</b><br>
            By the time the British announced their official support for Zionism in the 1917
            Balfour Declaration during World War I, the population of Palestine was about 750,000,
            approximately 94% Arab and 6% Jewish.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>1922</b><br>
            After the partition of the Ottoman Empire, British-ruled Mandatory Palestine began in 1922.
            By then, the Jewish population had grown to around 10%; both the Balfour Declaration
            and the Mandate for Palestine referred to the 90% Arab population as "existing non-Jewish communities.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>1947</b><br>
            In 1947, in the wake of World War II and the Holocaust, the United Nations partitioned
            Mandatory Palestine, leading to the 1948 Palestine war and the creation of the State of Israel.
            At the expiration of the Mandate, privately held lands amounted to approximately 25%
            of the total territory. Palestinian Arabs, who made up about two-thirds of the population,
            owned about 90% of privately held lands, while Jews, who made up between a quarter and a
            third of the population, owned about 7% of the total territory.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>1948</b><br>
            The central facts of the Nakba in 1948 are not disputed. Approximately 750,000
            Palestinians--over 80% of the population in what would become Israel--were expelled or fled
            from their homes and became refugees in neighboring states. About half were expelled or fled
            during the first stage of the 1948 Palestine war before Israel declared independence at
            the end of the British Mandate on 14 May 1948 and the second stage began on the following day.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>1949-1966</b><br>
            The Nakba continued after the end of the war in 1949. From 1948 to 1966, Palestinians in Israel
            lived under martial law and needed a permit to move from one village to another. Israel prevented
            Palestinian refugees outside of Israel from returning. Palestinians continued to be expelled,
            and more Palestinian towns and villages were destroyed, with new Jewish settlements established
            in their place. Palestinian place names and the name "Palestine" itself were removed from maps
            and books. Sixty-nine Palestinians were killed in the 1953 Qibya massacre; a few years later,
            49 Palestinians were killed in the Kafr Qasim massacre, on the first day of the 1956 Suez Crisis.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>1967-2023</b><br>
            During the 1967 Six-Day War, hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees were driven from the
            West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem. Most were driven into Jordan. This has become known as
            al-Naksa (the "setback"). After the war, Israel occupied the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
            Some two thousand Palestinians were killed in a massacre led by the Lebanese Front at the
            Siege of Tel al-Zaatar in 1976, during the Lebanese Civil War. Palestinian refugees in
            Lebanon were killed or displaced during the 1982 Lebanon War, including between 800 and 3,500 killed
            in the Sabra and Shatila massacre. The First Intifada began in 1987 and lasted until the 1993
            Oslo Accords. The Second Intifada began in 2000. In 2005, Israel withdrew from Gaza and blockaded it.
            In the West Bank and East Jerusalem, Israel has built the Israeli West Bank barrier and created
            Palestinian enclaves. In 2011, Israel passed the Nakba Law, which denies government funding to
            institutions that commemorate the Nakba.

            <b>2023-On Going</b><br>
            The 2023 Israel Genocide on Palestine has caused the highest Palestinian casualties since the 1948 ethnic-cleansing,
            and has raised fears among Palestinians that history will repeat itself. These fears were 
            exacerbated by Israeli Agricultural Minister Avi Dichter said that the war would end with 
            "Gaza Nakba 2023," (Dichter was rebuked by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu).
            <br>
            <br>
            <b><i>As i create this website and collect every information, the genocide still on going.
              It's already more than 3 months, and Israel has killed more than 20.600 human living 
              in Palestine in just 80 days. Including baby, childern, elderly, and women.<br>
              We need ceasefire NOW.</i></b>
